# ELF Header Parser

## Overview

The `elfparser` program is a simple ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file parser written in C. It reads and displays the contents of the ELF header from a specified ELF file, providing information such as the ELF magic number, class, data encoding, version, and other header fields.

## File Path

The file to be parsed is specified by the `FILE_PATH` macro in the source code. Modify this macro to point to the desired ELF file before compiling and running the program.

```c
#define FILE_PATH "/home/abdallah/tasks/task2/elfparser.o"
```

## Compilation

To compile the `elfparser` program, use the following command:

```sh
gcc -o elfparser elfparser.c
```

This command compiles the `elfparser.c` source file into an executable named `elfparser`.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program**:
   ```sh
   gcc -o elfparser elfparser.c
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   Execute the program by running:
   ```sh
   ./elfparser
   ```

   Ensure that the `FILE_PATH` macro in the source code points to a valid ELF file. The program will read the file and print the details of the ELF header to the standard output.

## Output

The program outputs the following details about the ELF header:

- **Magic Number**: The initial bytes of the ELF file used to identify the file format.
- **Class**: The class of the ELF file (e.g., ELF32 or ELF64).
- **Data Encoding**: The data encoding scheme (e.g., little endian or big endian).
- **Version**: The version of the ELF format.
- **OS/ABI**: The ABI (Application Binary Interface) identifier.
- **Type**: The type of the ELF file (e.g., relocatable, executable).
- **Machine**: The architecture for which the ELF file is intended (e.g., x86-64, ARM).
- **Version**: The version of the ELF specification.
- **Entry Point Address**: The address where the execution starts.
- **Program Header Offset**: The offset of the program header table.
- **Section Header Offset**: The offset of the section header table.
- **Flags**: Flags associated with the ELF file.
- **Size of ELF Header**: The size of the ELF header.
- **Size of Program Headers**: The size of one entry in the program header table.
- **Number of Program Headers**: The number of entries in the program header table.
- **Size of Section Headers**: The size of one entry in the section header table.
- **Number of Section Headers**: The number of entries in the section header table.
- **Section Header String Table Index**: The index of the section header string table.

## Error Handling

The program handles the following errors:

- **File Opening Error**: If the file cannot be opened, an error message is displayed.
- **File Reading Error**: If the file cannot be read successfully, an error message is displayed.
